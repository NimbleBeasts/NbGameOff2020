KEY_00,"Good morning agent, there you are at last. Today is a great day for you. It is a great honor to serve the country of Ustria. Our great leader wants to participate in the space race. We will be the first nation on the moon!",,
KEY_01,"Unfortunately we do not even have a rocket yet. And that is why you are here today. Our agency will obtain plans and secret documents to support our great scientists.",,
KEY_02,"Before you go on your first mission: In the basement is your office where you can save your progress, your colleague who can equip you with additional upgrades and a training parkour.",,
KEY_03,"You should complete the training parkour before going on your first mission. Do you have any questions?",,
CHOICE_03_0,"No, let's train.",,
CHOICE_03_1,"Where is my office?",,
CHOICE_03_2,"Go directly on mission",,
KEY_train,"The training center is located in the basement. Good luck, comrade.",,
KEY_skipTutorial,"Okay. If you change your mind, you can always go to the training rooms. Do you want to skip it now?",,
CHOICE_skipTutorial_0,"No, let's train.",,
CHOICE_skipTutorial_1,"Yes, skip it.",,
KEY_officeReply,"One floor down and then the door on the right side.",,
KEY_10,"Wow, that was really slow, even my grandma could have done it faster. But well, you just have to take what you get.",,
KEY_11,"Okay, your first mission will take you to the Soviet Union. Their rocket technology is the best in the world. Our researchers need these plans for, umm ... inspiration.",,
KEY_12,"My secretary Natasja prepared a detailed mission briefing for you. Take the car in front of the building to start the mission.",,
KEY_21,"So far, these seem very authentic. Even though a lot of glue and duct tape seems to be used in the construction.",,
KEY_23,"Good luck on your mission, Agent. Make the great leader proud.",,
KEY_20,"Welcome back comrade. Your first mission was a great success and our scientists are studying the plans.",,
KEY_30,"It seems that Titov suffered from some kind of seasickness. The space sickness. We have instructed our diplomats to collect all vomit bags during international flights.",,
KEY_31,"Well, I ordered you today, because there are first rumors about a manned American space flight. A guy named \Enzo\ is supposed to take over this flight.",,
KEY_22,"The Soviets had another manned space flight with the Vostok-2, with a cosmonaut spending a day in space. Your mission is to steal the medical records from the Soviet hospital.",,
KEY_32,"Infiltrate the NASA training site and get us photos of the training Mr. Enzo is doing.",,
KEY_41,"For your next \mission\ I need your utmost discretion. It's a... well, delicate subject. Can I count on you?",,
CHOICE_41_0,"Yes, Sir.",,
CHOICE_41_1,"It depends.",,
CHOICE_41_2,"This sounds dubious.",,
KEY_40,"Our source must have misunderstood something. Well, at least now we know how to train a chimpanzee. The source has dried up, if you know what I mean. Mistakes will not be tolarated.",,
KEY_42_ok,"I knew, comrade, that I could count on you.",,
KEY_42_no,"Oh come on, did you really think you had a choice? I'm your boss and that's an order.",,
KEY_43,"Okay, it's a little precarious. I think my wife is cheating on me. Observe my house while I'm at work and get me proof if necessary.",,
KEY_50,"I knew it. I had ignored the signs, but they were there all along.",,
KEY_52_okay,"All right, bring him to me. I will then take care of him.",,
KEY_51,"Okay, I need you to kidnap him. I will... well... \interrogate\ him. He lives in a hotel in the next town.",,
CHOICE_51_0,"Yes, Sir",,
CHOICE_51_1,"Is this really necessary?",,
KEY_52_why,"It is! He could have been specifically targeted at me. Besides, I now have a score to settle with him.",,
KEY_60,"Comrade! Today there is great news. Our scientists are making great progress with the development of our first own rocket",,
KEY_61,"However, news reaches us from our spy network in the USSR. It looks like the Soviets are developing a new booster for their Vostok missiles.",,
KEY_62,"Get us the plans from these boosters. They would be a great inspiration for our scientists.",,
CHOICE_62_0,"Yes, sir!",,
CHOICE_62_1,"Inspiration?",,
KEY_63_okay,"Good luck on your mission.",,
KEY_63_what,"You know, the kind of inspiration you used to need in school when you forgot your homework. But now let's go, good luck.",,
KEY_70,"Good job with the photos. I have forwarded these to the Ustria Space Center. I was also right about the affair. It is a young spy of the Soviets with the code name \Platov\.",,
KEY_71,"Our great leader will exchange him for some of our agents.It is said that he has a great future in the KGB.",,
CHOICE_71_0,"About his life?",,
CHOICE_71_1,"What about your wife?",,
KEY_72_life,"I would very much not end his life and that of my wife. But he has powerful allies in the KGB, so our great leader decided to exchange him for several of our agents.",,
KEY_80,"We are ready! The rocket is ready for launch. But in the final tests, the control unit failed again. We were asked to find a replacement.",,
KEY_81,"The Soviet control unit seems to be 100% compatible with ours for some reason. That is why we intend to \borrow\ one.",,
KEY_82,"Good luck with your mission. And many thanks for the contract.",,
KEY_90,"Comrade! The first missile test was a complete success for the great nation of Ustria. The great leader has demanded to increase the pace even more to further expand our technological advancement.",,
KEY_91,"The Soviets accuse us of espionage and claim our Great Ustria missile is a copy of their Vostok missiles. We expect them to significantly increase their security measures.",,
KEY_92,"That's why we need to significantly increase our agency's budget. The plan is to steal some of the Nazi gold in Switzerland to increase our funds.",,
KEY_100,"Agent, the Soviets have again launched a lunar mission. Rumor says that Luna took 3 photos of the moon.",,
KEY_101,"This could provide us with valuable information about possible landing sites on the Moon.",,
KEY_102,"Get us those photos.",,
KEY_73,"About my wife: I want a divorce, of course, but we have a very unfair marriage contract on file with a law firm. That's your next mission.",,
KEY_111,"Rather than just getting the files, this time they bring us the astronaut. We hope to get information from him about the NASA program.",,
KEY_110,"Welcome back Spy. It seems the Yanks are making great strides. They have completed an earth orbital mission. We have information about the location of  the astronaut.",,
KEY_112,"That's it. You may now leave.",,
KEY_120,"Comrade, our hostage was pretty talkative, we hardly had to use force. He mentioned a new project of NASA. The Apollo project. ",,
KEY_121,"The NASA director reportedly takes the plans home every night. Gain access to the house and photocopy the files.",,
KEY_122,"Natasja has the plane tickets as well as the briefing. Good luck.",,
KEY_130,"Comrade, we haven't been able to use you for a while. Your last mission caused an unwanted stir. But now that your only colleague has passed away on duty. We' re reevaluating the risk.",,
CHOICE_130_0,"What happend?",,
KEY_131,"What? About your ex-colleague or your exposure?",,
CHOICE_131_0,"My colleague",,
CHOICE_131_1,"My exposure",,
KEY_132,"He was going to drop out after a mission.",,
KEY_133,"Soviet intelligence was able to identify you. We could not reconstruct it. The good news...",,
KEY_134,"We will focus more on the U.S. They are making considerable progress with their Apollo program. But first you have to go back to the USSR one last time.",,
KEY_135,"The Soviets have a satellite in orbit of the moon.  We need these images to find a suitable landing site. I am confident that you will survive. Good luck.",,
KEY_140,"Welcome back! You have delivered interesting data, the scientists of the space program are still analyzing it.",,
KEY_141,"We have learned that the Americans have taken the Apollo program up a notch. That is why the great leader has instructed us to be tougher.",,
KEY_142,"We want to delay a possible launch of the Apollo program by sabotaging the command module. ",,
CHOICE_142_0,"About explosives",,
CHOICE_142_1,"About casualties",,
KEY_143,"No. Even though it would probably be the most effective, we would immediately be the suspects. We have to look strong.",,
KEY_144,"There will be no casualties. The Americans will do many tests and will eventually notice that something is wrong.",,
KEY_145,"Let's not waste any more time. Go there and sabotage the module.",,
KEY_150,"Comrade, welcome back. The last mission did not go as planned. It seems that all functional tests were completed before our sabotage.",,
KEY_151,"Nonetheless, this puts a big damper on the Apollo program. However, the price is high. Both the USA and the Soviets have increased their security measures. One of our spies was arrested in the Soviet Union.",,
KEY_152,"We know where they took him. However, we do not know what he will say. That's why your mission is to smuggle a listening device into the interrogation room and activate it there.",,
KEY_153,"That's all. Easy! Isn't it? Good luck",,
KEY_160,"Good evening. Our spy did not talk. That must have saved us a lot of trouble. We have learned that the USSR will soon make the first manned test flight with the new Soyuz.",,
KEY_161,"In this sabotage mission, we take a less subtle approach. The Soviets are transporting a solar panel on a train. Blow up the panel.",,
KEY_162,"Good luck.",,
KEY_170,"Welcome back. Despite our efforts, both the US and USSR are making great strides. Apollo 8 has just orbited the moon. ",,
KEY_171,"The landing capsule will land in the Pacific tonight. And you will be there, of course.",,
KEY_172,"Enter the salvage ship and get us the black box. The records could turn out to be extremely useful for our first orbit around the moon. Good luck.",,
KEY_180,"Hello Agent, it's been a while since your last mission. We're making great progress. But it seems the Americans are always one step ahead of us.",,
KEY_181,"Our intelligence was able to locate a new laboratory in which the moon landing is to be prepared. Search the building we need the mission briefing.",,
KEY_182,"The clock is ticking. Let's go.",,
KEY_190,"Comrade, what a surprise. We were pretty sure they were just faking the moon landing. But we found some clues in the documents.",,
KEY_191,"It looks like this is Plan B in case their Apollo 11 mission doesn't work out. We've identified an address. We believe there can the real mission briefing be found.",,
KEY_192,"Good luck comrade. For Ustria!",,
KEY_200,"Great work comrade. We did it! The Americans don't plan to launch until July. We will launch tonight.Our great leader has invited our entire staff to a celebration tonight.",,
KEY_201,"Go home and put on something decent. Today there is every reason to celebrate.",,
