# Agreement

This agreement is made by and between Markus Schneider - NimbleBeasts (or "NimbleBeasts" / "PM" in short), based at Erlenweg 2, 76571 Gaggenau, Germany, and [member_name_full] (or "[member_nick]" in short), based at [member_addr]. With this agreement, [member_nick] agrees to perform services for NimbleBeasts for the project tentatively titled 'Moonshot - The Great Espionage' on the following terms and conditions.

# Services and deadlines

The tasks and amount of services that [member_nick] will perform for Moonshot - The Great Espionage are up to [member_nick]. PM provides a Kanban based board with tasks and can assign it to a specific member or leave it to the members to pick a task to complete. Only tasks provided on the Kanban board are valid tasks and count toward the compensation.

PM needs to approve the work resulting from [member_nick]'s services before it is considered complete. NimbleBeasts will therefore try to continuously and clearly communicate what makes the work complete and will try to approve or disapprove the work resulting from the services as soon as possible. [member_nick] is aware that minor adjustments and fixes to the work are also part of the services. If PM accepts the result the tasks points will be added to the revenue share table (see compensation).

There are no deadlines defined for [member_nick] to complete the services but however the targeted release date is March, 1st 2021. As there are tasks that build on each other, [member_nick] promises to deliver in time to not hinder the launch. When [member_nick] becomes aware that [member_nick] is unable to complete the services on time, [member_nick] will immediately notify PM. If [member_nick] is unable to complete the services on time and NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] cannot agree on a deadline, NimbleBeasts can decide to no longer use [member_nick]’s services.

# Compensation

Starting with the Steam release, NimbleBeasts agrees to pay [member_nick] his/her percentage share of NimbleBeasts’s net income for Moonshot - The Great Espionage on a yearly or twice yearly base depending on how much money has been accumluated ("payout").
Net income is defined as the money that NimbleBeasts received from sales or other uses of Moonshot - The Great Espionage on Steam, Itch and further platforms minus the platform shares, minus the platforms money transfer costs. NimbleBeasts will share an overview of gross income with [member_nick] when [member_nick] wants to verify the payment amount but at least on a yearly base.

If the amount that NimbleBeasts owes to [member_nick] is less than $200, it will add up to the amount of the next payment interval and NimbleBeasts will not pay this interval.

All amounts in this agreement are excluding VAT (value added tax). [member_nick] will send invoices to receive payment(s) from NimbleBeasts, after which NimbleBeasts will make payment on agreed payment method within 30 days of receiving an invoice. [member_nick] will be responsible for all expenses made while performing the services under this agreement. Because [member_nick] is not an employee of NimbleBeasts, [member_nick] is not entitled to worker's compensation, retirement, insurance or other benefits afforded to employees of NimbleBeasts.

## Game Jam

If the [member_nick] was member of the Game Jam team for "GameOff 2020" he/she will receive a base compensation of 10%.

## Point Based Compensation

Every task on the Kanban board has a value ("points"). This value is determined by the PM and is agreed upon accepting the task. If there is a significant deviation of the actual effort and PM and [member_nick] cannot agree, the whole team should decide democratically upon the amount of points for this task. After the PM has accepted [member_nick]'s finished task, the PM add the points to a table. Before every payout the revenue share of all team member including [member_nick] is being calculated the following way:

- 100% of the net revenue will be splitted among the team members and [member_nick]
- 40% of the 100% will be given to the Game Jam members, 10% each.
- 10% of the 100% will be reserved and hold back for further team member acquisiton (additional workforce stake)
- Remaining percentage stake (at least 50%) will be splitted according to [member_nick] amount of points / total amount of points
- If upfront payments where made by NimbleBeasts for an additional workforce the additional workforce stake will be used to refinance the amount spent.
- If the 10% of the additional workforce pot is not used up it will count towards the remaining percentage stake

E.g.:
Dev1 was in jam and got 10 points out of 40 total => 10% + 12,5% = 22,5%

## PM Compensation

NimbleBeasts as the PM will receive 2 points per week for administrative tasks. This includes Kanban board management (adding and reviewing tasks), Twitter, pushing updates on itch and Steam and writing a devlog.

# Rights to the work

[member_nick] will remain owner of the rights to the work resulting from the services for this agreement, but gives NimbleBeasts the rights to use and distribute the work as part of Moonshot - The Great Espionage [scopeOfRights]. These rights include all art, images, designs, audio, videos, code, typography, and text, as they are delivered to NimbleBeasts, but NimbleBeasts can make minor changes to the work if needed. The rights [member_nick] gives to NimbleBeasts are non-exclusive, meaning that [member_nick] still has the rights to use the work for projects other than Moonshot - The Great Espionage without permission from NimbleBeasts. NimbleBeasts may not use the work that [member_nick] delivers to NimbleBeasts in projects other than Moonshot - The Great Espionage without written permission from [member_nick]. If Moonshot - The Great Espionage is made for another company or if Moonshot - The Great Espionage is distributed through another company, publisher, or platform, NimbleBeasts can give that company the same rights to use and distribute the work as part of Moonshot - The Great Espionage.

[member_nick] will make sure that NimbleBeasts can make full use of the work, which means that [member_nick] will only deliver work that [member_nick] made, or work from others if it comes with a license that allows the work to be included in Moonshot - The Great Espionage. If [member_nick] delivers work to NimbleBeasts that is claimed to infringe the rights of others, then [member_nick] will defend NimbleBeasts against these claims, and [member_nick] is responsible for all damages NimbleBeasts may suffer.

NimbleBeasts agrees to credit [member_nick] in- and outside of Moonshot - The Great Espionage following the industry standard. [member_nick] can showcase the work resulting from the services for [member_nick]'s portfolio, but if Moonshot - The Great Espionage is still unreleased, [member_nick] needs written permission from NimbleBeasts.

[member_nick] agrees not to disclose or use any confidential information of NimbleBeasts or Moonshot - The Great Espionage without NimbleBeasts's written permission, both during and after the term of this agreement.

In case of a disagreement
Both NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] cannot end the agreement without a good reason. In case of a disagreement, NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] will do their best to respectfully resolve the disagreement. If NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] cannot find a solution for their disagreement, and NimbleBeasts or [member_nick] wants to end the agreement, they need to give a seven day deadline to get to a solution.

If NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] did their best to resolve the disagreement during these seven days but could not come to a solution, this agreement can be ended, and any rights that NimbleBeasts already paid for before the disagreement stay with NimbleBeasts. NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] can come to an additional agreement about rights that NimbleBeasts has not yet paid for.

In case of a lasting conflict and NimbleBeasts and [member_nick] want to use arbitration or go to court, they can only do that in Baden-Württemberg, Germany using the laws of Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
